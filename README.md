## What is Dot.Ehail?

Dot.Ehail is the ride-hailing platform in the Dot ecosystem. It's the entrepreneurship layer for
the movement domain — the product an operator (from a single owner-driver to a multi-vehicle
fleet) launches to onboard drivers, register vehicles, take ride requests, and settle fares.

**Status:** early build. See [`wiki.md`](wiki.md) for the full, kept-honest breakdown of what's
actually implemented vs. still scaffolding/intent.

## Core Features (implemented today)

- Real ride-hailing schema: driver profiles, vehicles, rides, and ride ratings
- Live operations dashboard — ride counts by status, driver availability, revenue, recent rides
- Ride search & detail pages (`/rides`, `/rides/{ride}`)
- Driver profile page with ride history, restricted to the driver themselves (`/drivers/{driver}`)
- In-app notification bell (Laravel's `database` notification channel) for ride/driver events
- Dark / light mode toggle (Tailwind class-based strategy, persisted per browser)
- Ecosystem SSO from the Dot hub

> **Not yet built:** dispatch/nearest-driver matching, fare estimation, realtime driver tracking
> (Reverb is configured but unused), fleet-as-a-first-class-entity (currently only Jetstream
> `Team`), and Knowledge Pack publishing to Dot.Brain. See `wiki.md` §6 and §8 for the full
> scaffolding-vs-real breakdown and roadmap. Earlier drafts of this README described that target
> state as if it already shipped — it doesn't yet.

## Domain Models

- **DriverProfile** — a platform `User` who has applied/been approved to drive
- **Vehicle** — registered vehicle linked to a driver profile
- **Ride** — trip record from request through to completion, with a passenger and driver `User`
- **RideRating** — one rating per ride, from either the passenger or the driver

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Laravel 13 |
| Language | PHP 8.3+ |
| Auth & teams | Jetstream 5 (Livewire stack) + Sanctum |
| Frontend | Livewire 3 · Alpine.js 3 · Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (shared `infodot` database across the ecosystem) |
| Realtime | Laravel Reverb (configured in `.env.example`, not yet wired to any broadcast) |
| AI | Anthropic Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) — config only, no fare/dispatch logic calls it yet |
| Queue/cache/session | Redis queue; database cache & session |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakhileb/Dot.Ehail.git
cd Dot.Ehail
cp .env.example .env
composer install
npm install && npm run build
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

> **Ecosystem SSO:** Set `DB_*` env vars to the shared Dot PostgreSQL instance and
> `APP_URL=https://ehail.infodot.app`. Users authenticated elsewhere in the ecosystem gain access
> automatically via the Sanctum handoff at `/auth/ecosystem`.

### Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

Feature tests use an in-memory SQLite connection (see `phpunit.xml`) and Laravel's
`RefreshDatabase` trait — no shared Postgres instance required to run them.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. **Set environment**
   ```bash
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (no dev)**
   ```bash
   composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Build frontend assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Cache configuration**
   ```bash
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   php artisan event:cache
   ```

5. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```

6. **Start the queue worker** (use `deploy/queue-worker.service` for systemd or `deploy/queue-worker.supervisord.conf` for Supervisor). Requires `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`, matching `.env.production.example`.
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3 --timeout=90
   ```

7. **Start the Reverb WebSocket server** (use `deploy/reverb.service` for systemd or `deploy/reverb.supervisord.conf` for Supervisor) -- never run this as a bare foreground command in production, it needs the same process supervision as the queue worker.
   ```bash
   php artisan reverb:start
   ```
   Binds to `REVERB_SERVER_HOST`/`REVERB_SERVER_PORT` (loopback-only by default in `.env.production.example`) -- it is not meant to be reachable directly from the internet. See "WebSocket Reverse Proxy" below for how browsers actually reach it over `wss://`.

### Web Server Configuration

#### Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    http2 on;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /var/www/ehail/public;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.php;
    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }

    # WebSocket Reverse Proxy -- only Reverb's client-facing path
    # (/app/{key}, what Echo/pusher-js connects to) is proxied here. Its
    # server-to-server publish API (/apps/{id}/events etc.) is deliberately
    # NOT exposed publicly -- config/broadcasting.php's reverb connection
    # talks to it directly over the internal REVERB_SERVER_HOST/PORT
    # instead, so it never needs to be reachable from outside this box.
    # The Upgrade/Connection headers are what turn this from a plain HTTP
    # proxy into a WebSocket one; without them the client's protocol
    # upgrade handshake fails.
    location /app {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;
    }
}
```

#### Apache

Requires `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_wstunnel`, and `mod_ssl` enabled (`a2enmod proxy proxy_wstunnel ssl`).

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    Redirect permanent / https://your-domain.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/ehail/public

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile      /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem

    <Directory /var/www/ehail/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ProxyPass        /app ws://127.0.0.1:8080/app
    ProxyPassReverse /app ws://127.0.0.1:8080/app
</VirtualHost>
```

### Real-Time Health Check

`GET /up/realtime` checks broadcasting config, queue connection, and whether `reverb:start` is actually accepting connections -- independently, so it reports which link broke rather than a single healthy/unhealthy bit. See `app/Http/Controllers/RealtimeHealthController.php`.
